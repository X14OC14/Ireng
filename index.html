  <h1>nigga.my.id</h1>
  <p>This domain was originally intended for a small, private Minecraft server — a chaotic but exciting plan full of mods, cracked configs, and daydreams that fizzled out before the first block was placed.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, <span class="highlight">the domain name triggered Minecraft's internal filter</span> — no matter how genuine the context, the launcher wouldn't allow it.</p>

  <p>So here it is now: untouched, unused — but still mine. Not a slur, not hate, just a relic from a quirky chapter that never went live.</p>

  <p>Whether you're here by mistake or on purpose: welcome. This is a landing page for a domain that couldn't quite spawn into the world it was meant to.</p>
